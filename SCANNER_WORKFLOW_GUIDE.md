# SCANNER WORKFLOW GUIDE
## Stock Audit System - Complete Instructions

---

### YOUR JOB: COUNT EVERYTHING ACCURATELY
As a scanner, your main job is to scan every single item on your assigned racks and make sure the counts are correct. This guide shows you exactly how to do it.

---

## GETTING STARTED

### LOG IN
1. Go to the Stock Audit website
2. Sign in with your Google account (the one your supervisor gave you)
3. Wait for approval - Only authorized people can use this system

### FIRST TIME SETUP
- Your supervisor will add you to the system first
- Your account will be set to "Scanner" role

---

## STEP 1: PICK YOUR LOCATION AND RACK

### CHOOSE YOUR STORE LOCATION
1. Select your store from the dropdown menu
2. Only your assigned stores will show up

### PICK A RACK TO SCAN
You have 2 ways to pick a rack:

**Method 1: Choose from List**
1. Look at the "Available Racks" list
2. Pick any rack that shows "Available" (green)
3. Click on it - it's now yours to scan

**Method 2: Scan the Rack Barcode (Faster!)**
1. Find the rack barcode (format: DDMM-###, like 1808-001)
2. Scan it with your USB scanner or type it in
3. Rack gets assigned to you automatically

**IMPORTANT: You can only work on ONE RACK AT A TIME. Finish it completely before moving to the next one.**

---

## STEP 2: START SCANNING ITEMS

### HOW TO SCAN
1. Use your USB barcode scanner or type barcodes manually
2. Scan each item's barcode one by one
3. Each scan gets saved instantly - you'll see a checkmark or X
4. Keep scanning until you've counted everything on the rack

### WHAT THE SCREEN SHOWS YOU
- Green checkmark: Scan saved successfully
- Red X: Problem with scan (barcode might be damaged)
- Queue Status Badge: Shows how many scans are waiting to upload

### IF BARCODE WON'T SCAN
- Clean the barcode with a cloth
- Try scanning at different angles
- Type the numbers manually if you can read them
- Ask your supervisor if barcode is completely unreadable

### SCANNING TIPS
- Scan one item at a time - no shortcuts
- Count every single piece - even if there are 50 of the same thing
- Don't worry about duplicates - the system handles it
- Work steadily - each scan uploads automatically every 15 seconds

---

## STEP 3: REVIEW YOUR WORK

### BEFORE YOU SUBMIT
1. Tap "Review Scans" when you're done with the rack
2. Look through your list of everything you scanned
3. Use the search box to find specific items if needed

### REMOVE MISTAKES
- Found a wrong scan? Tap the trash icon next to it
- Delete it immediately - you can't remove scans after submission
- Double-check everything - this is your last chance to fix errors

### SUBMIT YOUR RACK
1. Happy with your scans? Tap "Complete Rack"
2. Rack changes to "Ready for Approval" (orange)
3. Your supervisor will review it

**REMEMBER: Once you submit, you can't add or remove scans. Make sure everything is correct!**

---

## IF YOUR RACK GETS REJECTED

### WHAT HAPPENS
- Your supervisor found problems with your scanning
- Rack shows "Rejected" (red) with a reason
- You need to fix it and re-submit

### HOW TO FIX IT
1. Read the rejection reason carefully
2. Go back to that rack - only you can fix it
3. Add missing items or remove wrong scans
4. Submit again when fixed

### COMMON REJECTION REASONS
- "Missing items from back of shelf"
- "Scanned wrong section"
- "Need to check damaged items"
- "Count seems too low/high"

---

## REPORTING DAMAGED ITEMS

### FOUND SOMETHING BROKEN?
1. Go to "Damage & Add-ons → Report Damage"
2. Scan or type the item's barcode
3. Choose damage level: Minor, Moderate, or Severe
4. Write what's wrong in detail
5. Take 3 photos: Overall view, close-up, side angle
6. Submit - Super user will review it

### CAMERA TIPS
- Good lighting helps photo quality
- Keep the camera steady for clear pictures
- Show the damage clearly in close-up photo
- Each photo gets compressed to save space

---

## ITEMS WITHOUT BARCODES (SUPERVISORS ONLY)
If you're a supervisor, you can create "Add-on" requests for items without barcodes:

1. Go to "Damage & Add-ons → Add-ons"
2. Fill in brand, name, quantity (required fields)
3. Add prices if you know them (optional)
4. Take 3 photos like damage reports
5. Submit for approval - Super user will review

**NOTE: Regular scanners cannot create add-on requests - ask your supervisor.**

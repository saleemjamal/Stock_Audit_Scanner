## 🎯 **Your Job: Count Everything Accurately**

As a scanner, your main job is to scan every single item on your assigned racks and make sure the counts are correct. This guide shows you exactly how to do it.

---

## 📱 **Getting Started**

### **Log In**
1. **Open the app** on your phone or go to the website
2. **Sign in** with your Google account (the one your supervisor gave you)
3. **Wait for approval** - Only authorized people can use this system

### **First Time Setup**
- Your supervisor will add you to the system first
- You'll get an email invitation if using the phone app
- Your account will be set to "Scanner" role

## 🏪 **Step 1: Pick Your Location and Rack**

### **Choose Your Store Location**
1. **Select your store** from the dropdown menu
2. **Only your assigned stores** will show up

### **Pick a Rack to Scan**
You have 2 ways to pick a rack:

**Method 1: Choose from List**
1. **Look at the "Available Racks" list**
2. **Pick any rack** that shows "Available" (green)
3. **Click on it** - it's now yours to scan

**Method 2: Scan the Rack Barcode** *(Faster!)*
1. **Find the rack barcode** (format: DDMM-###, like 1808-001)
2. **Scan it with your phone** or type it in
3. **Rack gets assigned to you automatically**

> **Important**: You can only work on **ONE RACK AT A TIME**. Finish it completely before moving to the next one.

## 📦 **Step 2: Start Scanning Items**

### **How to Scan**
1. **Use your phone camera** OR **plug in a USB barcode scanner**
2. **Scan each item's barcode** one by one
3. **Each scan gets saved instantly** - you'll see a ✅ or ❌
4. **Keep scanning** until you've counted everything on the rack

### **What the Screen Shows You**
- **Green ✅**: Scan saved successfully
- **Red ❌**: Problem with scan (barcode might be damaged)
- **Queue Status Badge**: Shows how many scans are waiting to upload

### **If Barcode Won't Scan**
- **Clean the barcode** with a cloth
- **Try different angle** with your camera
- **Type the numbers manually** if you can read them
- **Ask your supervisor** if barcode is completely unreadable

### **Scanning Tips**
- **Scan one item at a time** - no shortcuts
- **Count every single piece** - even if there are 50 of the same thing
- **Don't worry about duplicates** - the system handles it
- **Work steadily** - each scan uploads automatically every 15 seconds

## 🔍 **Step 3: Review Your Work**

### **Before You Submit**
1. **Tap "Review Scans"** when you're done with the rack
2. **Look through your list** of everything you scanned
3. **Use the search box** to find specific items if needed

### **Remove Mistakes**
- **Found a wrong scan?** Tap the **🗑️ trash icon** next to it
- **Delete it immediately** - you can't remove scans after submission
- **Double-check everything** - this is your last chance to fix errors

### **Submit Your Rack**
1. **Happy with your scans?** Tap **"Complete Rack"**
2. **Rack changes to "Ready for Approval"** (orange)

## ❌ **If Your Rack Gets Rejected**

### **What Happens**
- **Your supervisor found problems** with your scanning
- **Rack shows "Rejected" (red)** with a reason
- **You need to fix it** and re-submit

### **How to Fix It**
1. **Read the rejection reason** carefully
2. **Go back to that rack** - only you can fix it
3. **Add missing items** or **remove wrong scans**
4. **Submit again** when fixed

### **Common Rejection Reasons**

- "Scanned wrong section"
- "Need to check damaged items"
- "Count seems too low/high"

## 📱 **Web Dashboard vs Phone App**

2. **Scan or type the item's barcode**
3. **Choose damage level**: Minor, Moderate, or Severe
4. **Write what's wrong** in detail
5. **Take 3 photos**: Overall view, close-up, side angle
6. **Submit** - Super user will review it

### **Camera Tips**
- **Good lighting** helps photo quality
- **Hold phone steady** for clear pictures
- **Show the damage clearly** in close-up photo
- **Each photo gets compressed** to save space

## ➕ **Items Without Barcodes** *(Supervisors Only)*

If you're a supervisor, you can create "Add-on" requests for items without barcodes:

1. **Go to "Damage & Add-ons → Add-ons"**
2. **Fill in brand, name, quantity** (required fields)
3. **Add prices** if you know them (optional)
4. **Take 3 photos** like damage reports
5. **Submit for approval** - Super user will review

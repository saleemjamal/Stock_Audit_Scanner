### Database Schema
- **users**: Google OAuth with email-based authentication and roles (scanner, supervisor, superuser)
- **locations**: Physical store locations
- **audit_sessions**: Audit session management
- **racks**: Auto-generated racks with approval workflow
- **scans**: Individual barcode scans with offline sync support

### User Roles & Platform Access
| Role | Mobile App | Web Dashboard | Capabilities |
|------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Scanner** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | Scan items, mark racks complete |
| **Supervisor** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | All scanner features + approve/reject + reports |
| **Super User** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | All features + user management + location management |

### Key Features
1. **Google OAuth + Whitelisting**: Only pre-authorized users can access the system
2. **Offline-First Mobile**: SQLite local storage with background sync
3. **USB Scanner Support**: Direct barcode input via USB OTG
4. **Rack Approval Workflow**: Scanner ‚Üí Ready for Approval ‚Üí Supervisor Review
5. **Real-time Updates**: Supabase subscriptions for live dashboard
6. **Role-Based Access**: Platform restrictions based on user role
7. **Dual-Platform Supervisors**: Can use both mobile and web for flexibility

## Environment Setup

### Mobile (.env in mobile/)
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Dashboard (.env.local in dashboard/)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

## Testing Approach

### Mobile Testing
- Unit tests with Jest (`npm test`)
- Component testing with React Native Testing Library
- E2E tests with Detox (configured but requires device)
- Test offline sync scenarios

### Dashboard Testing
- TypeScript for type safety
- Manual testing of real-time features
- Test supervisor approval workflow
- Verify location-based filtering

## Key Development Considerations

1. **Google OAuth Security**: Only pre-authorized users (added by superuser) can access system
2. **Role-Based Access**: Enforce platform restrictions (scanners mobile-only, supervisors both)
3. **Offline Sync**: Mobile app must handle offline scanning and sync when online
4. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard should show live scanning activity
5. **Permissions**: Respect Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
6. **Scanner Hardware**: Support USB OTG barcode scanners in HID keyboard mode
7. **Performance**: Optimize for older Android devices used in warehouse environments
8. **Super User Flexibility**: saleem@poppatjamals.com needs full system access
9. **Supervisor Dual-Access**: Supervisors use web for approvals, mobile for hands-on work

## Business Requirements (Clarified)

### Core Workflow
- **Blind Counting Only**: No expected quantities shown (reduces bias)
- **Full Audit Mode**: Primary use case for twice-yearly complete inventory counts
- **Manual Rack Selection**: Scanners choose their own racks (no auto-assignment)
- **Universal Approval**: Every rack requires supervisor approval (no exceptions)
- **Individual Scanning**: One scan per item (no batch/quantity entry)

### Must-Have Features
1. **Real-time Progress Indicators** (Mobile): Show completion %, speed, time estimates
2. **Session Continuity**: Auto-save each scan, crash recovery, rack reassignment
3. **Dashboard KPIs** (Web): Accuracy, throughput, first-pass yield, cycle time
4. **Swipe to Undo** (Mobile): Quick error correction for last scan
5. **Dual Status Views** (Web): Rack-wise and scanner-wise monitoring

### NOT Implementing (Per User Feedback)
- Auto-rack assignment (keep manual selection)
- Variance tracking (no inventory system yet)
- Bulk approval (individual approval required)
- Voice feedback (unnecessary complexity)
- Batch scanning with quantities (one scan per item)
- Exception-based approval (all racks need review)

## Implementation Approach

Follow the **phased development** approach documented in `/docs/Implementation_Simplification_Guide.md`:

### Phase 1: MVP (2 hours)
- Username/password authentication
- Basic mobile scanning
- Database connection

### Phase 2: Core Workflow (4 hours)  
- Rack selection and management
- Supervisor approval workflow
- Complete audit cycle

### Phase 3: Polish (6 hours)
- User management interface
- Location management
- UI/UX improvements

### Phase 4: Advanced (8 hours)
- Reporting and analytics
- Advanced admin features
- Performance optimizations

2. **Emergency Fallback**: True optimistic UI (clear input regardless of DB performance)
3. **USB Scanner Testing** - Test physical USB barcode scanner (once DB performance fixed)
4. **Complete Dashboard Components** - Finish LocationStats and RecentActivity components

üìã **Future Enhancements Documented**: 
1. **User-Controlled Duplicate Handling** - Last 5 scans with swipe-to-delete (see `docs/Future Enhancements/0808_Duplicate_Handling.md`)
2. **Legacy Code Refactoring** - Cleanup plan documented (see `docs/Future Enhancements/0808Code_Refactor.md`)
3. **Firebase App Distribution** - Team testing deployment strategy (see `docs/Future Enhancements/0808deployment.md`)

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. React Native Reanimated & Gesture Handler Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: `react-native-gesture-handler` requires `react-native-reanimated` which causes build failures
- **Solution**: Migrated from `@react-navigation/stack` to `@react-navigation/native-stack`
- **Benefits**: No reanimated dependency, native performance, simpler dependency tree
- **Files Changed**: All navigation files use `createNativeStackNavigator` instead of `createStackNavigator`

### 2. Authentication Workaround
- **Issue**: Supabase Auth complexity with OAuth requirements
- **Solution**: Custom RPC function (`login_with_username`) with standalone auth
- **Files**: `mobile/src/store/slices/authSliceWorkaround.ts`, `supabase/15_standalone_auth_fixed.sql`

### 3. Missing Java Bootstrap Files (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: React Native project missing `MainActivity.java` and `MainApplication.java`
- **Solution**: Manually created required Java files in `android/app/src/main/java/com/stockauditscanner/`
- **Note**: These should auto-generate but didn't - manual creation fixed app crashes

### 4. SQLite Performance Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Database initialization taking 30+ seconds, causing app timeout
- **Solution**: 
  - Simplified database creation to essential tables only
  - Reduced timeout from 30s to 10s with graceful fallback
  - Added online-only mode when SQLite initialization fails
  - Created hybrid approach: local storage when available, direct server sync as backup
- **Result**: App starts quickly regardless of SQLite status, maintains offline capability when possible

### 5. Metro Bundler Shared Folder Access (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Cannot import from `shared/` folder outside React Native directory
- **Solution**: Updated `metro.config.js` to include shared folder in watchFolders
- **File**: `mobile/metro.config.js`

### 6. Environment Variables Loading (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: `react-native-config` returning undefined, causing Supabase init to fail
- **Solution**: Added optional chaining and hardcoded fallbacks for Supabase URL/key
- **File**: `mobile/src/services/supabase.ts`

### 7. Barcode Scanning Performance Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: Duplicate checking logic adding 50-100ms delay per scan, blocking rapid scanning workflow
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed automatic duplicate checking and `is_recount`/`recount_of` fields
  - Eliminated schema mismatch between mobile and server (no more PGRST204 errors)
  - Streamlined scan flow to direct save without validation delays
  - Documented user-controlled duplicate handling for future enhancement
- **Result**: 3x faster scanning, supports multiple items per minute, cleaner code architecture

### 8. Wireless Debugging Setup (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: USB port needed for barcode scanner testing, preventing wired debugging
- **Solution**: 
  - Configured Android wireless debugging (adb pair + adb connect)
  - Manual Metro bundler host configuration on device
  - Proper network setup for React Native development
- **Result**: Mobile app running on physical device while keeping USB port available for scanner testing

### 9. SQLite Performance Crisis (CRITICAL - URGENT)
- **Problem**: Local database saves taking **60+ seconds per scan** - completely unusable for warehouse operations
- **Suspected Causes**: 
  - Database corruption or file system locks
  - `react-native-sqlite-storage` performance limitations
  - No WAL mode or transaction optimization
  - Potential Android storage permissions issues
- **Impact**: Scanning workflow completely blocked, system unusable
- **Solution**: Immediate implementation of Enhancement #1 (op-sqlite) + #4 (batch operations)
- **Status**: **CRITICAL BLOCKER** - requires immediate attention before further testing

### Platform Considerations
- **Windows Development**: Use `cd android && gradlew` (without ./)
- **React Native**: Using v0.73.2 (stable version without reanimated)
- **Android SDK Path**: Must set ANDROID_HOME environment variable

### Database Constraints
- **No Foreign Key to auth.users**: Using standalone users table
- **Manual Password Hashing**: Using pgcrypto extension for bcrypt

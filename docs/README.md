## 🚀 System Overview

**Purpose**: Replace laptop-based barcode scanning with mobile solution for retail inventory audits

**Key Features**:
- USB barcode scanner integration (wired for reliability)
- Dropdown rack selection (no manual entry errors)
- Supervisor approval workflow
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Multi-location support
- Offline capability with auto-sync
- Audit session management
- Local SQLite database for uninterrupted scanning
- Background sync when reconnected

**Users**:
- Scanners: Gmail login, scan items, mark racks ready
- Supervisors: Google SSO, approve/reject racks
- Admins: Full system management

## 🏗️ Architecture (Supabase Recommended)

```
Mobile App (React Native) ──┐
                           ├──► Supabase Platform
Web Dashboard (Next.js) ────┘    ├─ PostgreSQL
                                 ├─ Authentication  
                                 ├─ Realtime
                                 └─ Auto APIs
```

## 📱 Key Workflows

1. **Admin** starts audit → sets location + rack count (e.g., 50 racks)
2. **Scanner** logs in → selects from dropdown of available racks
3. Scans items (automatically tagged with selected rack)
4. Clicks "Ready for Approval"
5. **Supervisor** sees notification → reviews count
6. Approves (rack locked) OR Rejects (recount required)
7. Process repeats until all racks approved
8. **Admin/Supervisor** completes audit → generates reports

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Mobile**: React Native + Redux + USB OTG
- **Web**: Next.js 14 + Material-UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (web) + Play Store (mobile)

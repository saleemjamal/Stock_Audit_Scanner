# Immediate Priorities - Stock Audit Scanner System

Based on user feedback, these are the features to implement NOW in the core system.

## âœ… Core Requirements (Keep As-Is)

1. **Blind Count Only** - System already does blind counts (no expected quantities shown)
2. **Full Audit Mode** - Primary functionality for twice-yearly stock audits
3. **Manual Rack Selection** - Scanners choose their own racks (no auto-assignment)
4. **Every Rack Needs Approval** - No exceptions or auto-approval
5. **Simple Scanning** - One scan per item (no batch mode with quantities)

## ðŸŽ¯ Features to Implement Now

### 1. Real-time Progress Indicators (Mobile App)
Show scanners their progress and performance:
- **Location-level**: "45% complete, 3 scanners active"
- **Session-level**: "Est. 2.5 hours remaining at current pace"
- **Scanner-level**: "Your speed: 85 items/hour (team avg: 72)"

### 2. Session Continuity Features
Robust recovery and continuation:
- **Auto-save every scan** (not just on rack completion)
- **Resume exactly where left off** after app crash
- **Supervisor can reassign abandoned racks** after timeout (e.g., 30 minutes)

Implementation notes:
- Already have SQLite for offline storage
- Minimal complexity: just more frequent saves
- Storage impact: negligible (scan records are small)
- Processing: background save after each scan

### 3. Dashboard KPIs (Web Dashboard)
Essential metrics for supervisors:
1. **Accuracy Rate**: (Approved racks / Total completed racks)
2. **Throughput**: Items/hour per scanner
3. **First-Pass Yield**: Racks approved without rejection
4. **Cycle Time**: Hours from session start to current
5. **Coverage**: % of racks completed (completed/total racks)

### 4. Swipe to Undo Last Scan (Mobile)
Simple gesture for error correction:
- Swipe left on last scan to remove it
- Confirmation dialog: "Remove scan for [barcode]?"
- Only works for current session's scans

### 5. Visual Rack Map (Web Dashboard)
Show rack locations spatially for supervisors:
- Grid/map view of warehouse layout
- Color coding: Available (green), In Progress (yellow), Complete (blue), Rejected (red)
- Click rack for details and scanner assignment

### 6. Status Views for Supervisors
Both rack-wise and user-wise status on dashboard:
- **Rack View**: List all racks with status, scanner, time elapsed
- **Scanner View**: List all scanners with current rack, items/hour, racks completed

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Priority Order

1. **Session Continuity** (Critical for reliability)
2. **Dashboard KPIs** (Essential for supervision)
3. **Progress Indicators** (Motivates scanners)
4. **Status Views** (Better oversight)
5. **Swipe to Undo** (Quality of life)
6. **Visual Rack Map** (Nice to have)

## ðŸš« NOT Implementing Now

These were suggested but rejected or deferred:

- **Auto-rack assignment** - Keep manual selection
- **Variance tracking** - No inventory system integration yet
- **Bulk approval** - Every rack needs individual approval
- **Voice feedback** - Unnecessary complexity
- **Quick actions bar** - Not needed
- **Batch scanning with quantities** - Keep one scan per item
- **Exception-based approval** - All racks need approval

## ðŸ’¾ Technical Implementation Notes

### Session Continuity
```javascript
// Save after each scan
const addScan = async (scanData) => {
  await saveToLocalDB(scanData);  // Immediate local save
  await syncQueue.add(scanData);   // Queue for server sync
};

// Resume on app restart
const resumeSession = async () => {
  const lastRack = await getLastActiveRack();
  if (lastRack && !lastRack.completed) {
    return { resume: true, rack: lastRack };
  }
};
```

### Progress Indicators
```javascript
// Calculate in real-time
const getProgress = () => ({
  locationProgress: (completedRacks / totalRacks) * 100,
  scannerSpeed: scansLastHour / 1,
  estimatedCompletion: calculateETA(currentSpeed, remainingRacks),
  activeScannersCount: getActiveScannersInLocation()
});
```

### Dashboard KPIs
```sql
-- Accuracy Rate
SELECT 
  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'approved')::float / 
   COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('approved', 'rejected'))) * 100 as accuracy_rate
FROM racks WHERE audit_session_id = ?;

-- Throughput
SELECT 
  scanner_id,
  COUNT(*) / EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (NOW() - MIN(created_at))) as items_per_hour
FROM scans 
WHERE audit_session_id = ? 
GROUP BY scanner_id;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

The system is ready when:
1. âœ… Scanners see their real-time progress
2. âœ… App recovers gracefully from crashes
3. âœ… Supervisors have KPI dashboard
4. âœ… Quick error correction with swipe
5. âœ… Clear visibility of all rack and scanner status
6. âœ… Full audit workflow works end-to-end

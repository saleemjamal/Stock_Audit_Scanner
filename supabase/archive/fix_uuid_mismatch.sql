-- Fix UUID Mismatch Between auth.users and users Tables
-- This script safely updates the users table UUID to match auth.users UUID
-- Resolves authentication issues preventing rack access in mobile app

-- Problem: users.id = 8f7c25c4-0d6e-43fb-bcbc-3c18fae708b2
--          auth.users.id = 585fdf7a-b696-4001-8d74-39497a8c0420
-- Solution: Update users.id to match auth.users.id

üì± MOBILE APP TESTING:
1. Build and run: cd mobile && npx react-native run-android
2. Login with: saleem/password123 (should work with new auth)
3. Should see 4 locations now (auth integration fixed)
4. Select Downtown Store ‚Üí Should see 20 racks

üñ•Ô∏è WEB DASHBOARD TESTING:  
1. Start dashboard: cd dashboard && npm run dev
2. Login with: saleem/password123 (should work with new auth)
3. Should see dashboard with audit data

‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All logins work with username/password (same UX)
- Location loading works in mobile app
- Both platforms use same authentication system
- All data accessible with proper permissions

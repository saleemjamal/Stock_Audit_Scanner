## RACK APPROVAL PROCESS - YOUR MAIN JOB

### WHAT NEEDS APPROVAL
Every completed rack comes to you for review before it's finalized.

### APPROVAL WORKFLOW
1. Scanner finishes rack → Status: "Ready for Approval" (orange)
2. You review the work → Approve or reject with reason
3. If approved → Rack marked complete (green)
4. If rejected → Scanner must fix and re-submit

### HOW TO REVIEW RACKS

#### GO TO APPROVALS PAGE
1. Navigate to "Approvals" in main menu
2. See "Racks" tab (your main responsibility)
3. List shows all pending racks for your locations

#### REVIEW EACH RACK
1. Click the eye icon to see scan details
2. Review the complete scan list
3. Check for obvious problems:
   - Count seems too low/high for the rack size
   - Missing common items you'd expect to see
   - Duplicate scans of expensive items
   - Wrong location or rack number

#### MAKE YOUR DECISION
**To Approve:**
- Click green checkmark
- Rack gets marked "Approved"
- Scanner can move to next rack

**To Reject:**
- Click red X
- Write detailed reason for rejection
- Be specific: "Missing items from back shelf", "Check damaged products", etc.
- Scanner gets notification and must fix the issues

### REJECTION BEST PRACTICES
**Good Rejection Messages:**
- "Check back row - seems like items were missed"
- "Count looks too low for this rack size, please re-scan carefully"
- "Found damaged items not reported - please document them"

**Poor Rejection Messages:**
- "Wrong" (not helpful)
- "Redo it" (doesn't explain what's wrong)
- "Mistakes" (too vague)

---

## QUALITY CONTROL & BEST PRACTICES

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR
- Scan Count vs Rack Size: Small rack with 200+ scans might be wrong
- Missing Categories: Food rack with no beverages seems incomplete
- Damaged Items: Scanner should report obvious damage
- Scanner Behavior: Same person consistently having low counts

### TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES
- Pattern Recognition: Help scanners identify what they're missing
- Efficiency Tips: Share best practices between team members
- Equipment Usage: Ensure proper USB scanner setup and web system usage
- Safety Reminders: Proper lifting, ladder usage, warehouse safety

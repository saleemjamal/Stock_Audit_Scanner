## ‚úÖ **Rack Approval Process - Your Main Job**

### **What Needs Approval**
**Every completed rack** comes to you for review before it's finalized.

### **Approval Workflow**
1. **Scanner finishes rack** ‚Üí Status: "Ready for Approval" (orange)
2. **You review the work** ‚Üí Approve or reject with reason
3. **If approved** ‚Üí Rack marked complete (green)
4. **If rejected** ‚Üí Scanner must fix and re-submit

### **How to Review Racks**

#### **Go to Approvals Page**
1. **Navigate to "Approvals"** in main menu
2. **See "Racks" tab** (your main responsibility)
3. **List shows all pending racks** for your locations

#### **Review Each Rack**
1. **Click the üëÅÔ∏è (eye) icon** to see scan details
2. **Review the complete scan list**
3. **Check for obvious problems:**
   - Count seems too low/high for the rack size
   - Missing common items you'd expect to see
   - Duplicate scans of expensive items
   - Wrong location or rack number

#### **Make Your Decision**
**To Approve:**
- **Click ‚úÖ green checkmark**
- **Rack gets marked "Approved"**
- **Scanner can move to next rack**

**To Reject:**
- **Click ‚ùå red X**
- **Write detailed reason** for rejection
- **Be specific**: "Missing items from back shelf", "Check damaged products", etc.
- **Scanner gets notification** and must fix the issues

### **Rejection Best Practices**
**Good Rejection Messages:**
- ‚úÖ "Check back row - seems like items were missed"
- ‚úÖ "Count looks too low for this rack size, please re-scan carefully"
- ‚úÖ "Found damaged items not reported - please document them"

**Poor Rejection Messages:**
- ‚ùå "Wrong" (not helpful)
- ‚ùå "Redo it" (doesn't explain what's wrong)
- ‚ùå "Mistakes" (too vague)

---

## üîç **Quality Control & Best Practices**

### **What to Look For**
- **Scan Count vs Rack Size**: Small rack with 200+ scans might be wrong
- **Missing Categories**: Food rack with no beverages seems incomplete
- **Damaged Items**: Scanner should report obvious damage
- **Scanner Behavior**: Same person consistently having low counts

### **Training Opportunities**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Help scanners identify what they're missing
- **Efficiency Tips**: Share best practices between team members
- **Equipment Usage**: Ensure proper USB scanner setup and phone app usage
- **Safety Reminders**: Proper lifting, ladder usage, warehouse safety
